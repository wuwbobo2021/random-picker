# random-picker

Generates random choices based on the weight table of probabilities. It can be used to calculate each item's probability of being picked up when picking a given amount of non-repetitive items (multi-thread), or to compare the speed of OS random source with that of the CSPRNG.

Documentation: <https://docs.rs/random_picker/latest>.

Current version of this program is able to load table files created by [the old C++ version](https://github.com/wuwbobo2021/random-picker/releases/tag/0.1), just for comparing their behaviors.

This project is looking for new maintainers having more knowledge and interests in this topic.
